    "Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to build towers and bridges with their blocks and cars. Tom was very proud of his tall tower. He wanted to make it even taller, so he reached for more blocks.\n",
    "\"Tom, can I have some blocks too?\" Lily asked. She wanted to make a bridge for her cars.\n",
    "\"No, these are mine. Go find your own,\" Tom said. He did not want to share with his sister. He pulled the blocks closer to him.\n",

    "Mommy and Daddy came to see their house. They praised them and gave them a treat. It was a lemon cake. It was sour, but they liked it. They learned that sharing is caring, and that family is sweet.\n",

    "So, Lucy smiled at the girl and said, \"Can we play together?\" The little girl softened and smiled back. She agreed to share the toy and even let Lucy have a turn first.\n",
